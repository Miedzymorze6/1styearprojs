Here an evolutionary algorith implemented. Key notes :
A - brown eye chromosome 
B - blue eye chromosome
G - green eye chromosome

Each iteration, mating of individuals happen and offsprings pass on new generation. There is natural reduction on individuals having Brown eyes (9%) and individuals with fitness below average (50%). 
In readme.txt.txt, the process of evolution can be seen and observed.
